# This is a hacky way to use juptyer notebooks w/o having to duplicate code
# outside the notebook for the purposes of debugging.
# you can sync code frags between the notebooks and disk using the juptyer magic words

# uncomment to read the cell from file
#%load read_data.py

#uncomment to write the cell to file
%%writefile read_data.py

# concatentate python frags into final.py (good for debugging)
# currently only read_data.py - update if you add more
./build.rb
