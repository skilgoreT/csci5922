# This is a hacky way to use juypter notebooks w/o having to duplicate code
# outside the notebook for the purposes of debugging. You can sync code frags
# between the notebooks and disk using the juypter magic words below

# uncomment to read the cell from file
#%load read_student_vectors.py

#uncomment to write the cell to file
%%writefile read_student_vectors.py

# concatentate python frags into final.py (good for debugging)
# currently only read_student_vectors.py - update if you add more
./build.rb
